About me:

Hello, My name is Mason. I am currently 18 years old and a Senior in Highschool. I have been programming for roughly 3 years now, 
starting in Java. Most of my development knowledge roots from the SpigotAPI, a API used to create Minecraft plugins. 
I have also used many different languages. I am always willing to try something new, so feel free to contact me. Throughout Higschool thus far,
I have maintained a 3.5 GPA while enrolled in AP and advanced classes. After Highschool I plan to presue a carrer in Computer Science
